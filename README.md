# ðŸ›’ Walmart Weekly Sales Forecasting

This project is part of a time series forecasting challenge using the Walmart dataset. The objective is to forecast weekly sales for **Department 3** using a variety of models ranging from statistical techniques to advanced deep learning and machine learning methods.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- Cleaned Walmart dataset with multiple departments
- Filtered to use only **Department 3**
- Target: `Weekly_Sales`
- Features: `Temperature`, `IsHoliday`, `Date`, etc.

---

## ðŸ”§ Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preparation
- Filtered for `Dept == 3`
- Handled dates and set time index
- Visualized weekly sales and moving averages

### 2. Time Series Analysis
- Identified trend and seasonality
- Analyzed ACF and PACF
- Evaluated external regressors (e.g., temperature, holidays)

### 3. Classical Time Series Models
- **Holtâ€™s Linear Trend**
- **Holt-Winters Seasonal Method**
- **ARIMA**, **SARIMA**, **SARIMAX**

### 4. Machine Learning Regressors
- Feature engineering with lags, time components
- Trained:
  - Random Forest
  - XGBoost

### 5. Deep Learning Models
- ANN (Feedforward)
- LSTM (Sequential Memory Model)

### 6. Facebook Prophet
- Trended and seasonal forecasts
- Component-based interpretation

### 7. Innovative Model
- Implemented **N-BEATS** using the Darts library

## ðŸš€ Deployment

- Deployed the XGBoost model using **Streamlit**
- Simple interactive interface allows:
  - Inputting lag features, temperature, holiday, date
  - Viewing weekly sales predictions

### Run Locally:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
